# Three.js Blender Import/Export

Imports and exports Three.js' ASCII JSON format.

## Installation

Copy the io_mesh_threejs folder to the scripts/addons folder. If it doesn't exist, create it. The full path is OS-dependent (see below).

Once that is done, you need to activate the plugin. Open Blender preferences, look for
Addons, search for `three`, enable the checkbox next to the `Import-Export: three.js format` entry.

Goto Usage.

### Windows

Should look like this:

    C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.6X\scripts\addons

### OSX

Depends on where blender.app is. Assuming you copied it to your Applications folder:

    /Applications/Blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/2.6X/scripts/addons

### Linux

By default, this should look like:

    /home/USERNAME/.config/blender/2.6X/scripts/addons

For Ubuntu users who installed Blender 2.6.8 via apt-get, this is the location:

    /usr/lib/blender/scripts/addons
    

## Usage

Activate the Import-Export addon under "User Preferences" > "Addons" and then use the regular Import and Export menu within Blender, select `Three.js (js)`.
